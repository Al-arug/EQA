# Notes

Two parts:

(1) We examined the dataset and it turned out the quetions are very limited. So the performance reported in the previous paper was not entirely representative: it is hard to say that QA has a storng role in the task which is dominated by navigation. We need more natural questions to expnad the QA task and make it more natural.

(2) We need to add questions: but which ones?

(3) How does the system then perform with these questions? The task will be harder (-performance) but questions might be helpful (+performance). (a) Compare the existing model with a transformer or (b) start with the existing model or transformer?

(4) (If a) then is transformer performing better?
